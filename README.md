| Background Informations |
---------------------------

Digitization has revolutionized all industry sectors. Now everything has become easy and digital in this modern world. People are getting their essential items at their fingertips in no time. So, to cope with the digital world, we also need to be advanced and provide the best services to people. But still, the medical sector is not advanced yet.

From research, we found that about 90 million people are affected by any diseases in Bangladesh. In most hospitals, various types of medicines are needed all the time. But currently, all medicines are not available all the time. Also, people sick at home can not go to stores to buy medicine. A delivery service should be provided to those people at home.

Medic-M is deals with the medical components and is a marketplace for daily life medical equipment. This system will make providing the best medicine to the consumers with all the precautions possible.
